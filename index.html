			This is inside basic html container
			<p> This is text contained inside of a standard easily-stylable tag </p>
			</p> Q1: For .js file: // Created by: Leslie Nguyen, 2022 <p>
			</p> Q1.2: For .css file: /* Created by: Leslie Nguyen, 2022 */ <p>
			</p> Q2: I think it's because since JavaScript is used to modify or make CSS and HTML elements interactable, the HTML and CSS must be loaded first for the .js script to work properly.<p>
			</p> Q3: The 'onload' executes the .js script after the page is loaded, I think? So that'll display and execute what the code inside is intending to do <b>explicitly</b>. <p>
			</p> Q4: I think cityPop is a variable, which has numbers and strings, which also ressembles a dictionary in Python (that contains numbers and strings).<p>
			</p> <b> Note: You may click anywhere on the map to get latitude and longitude values. </b> </p>
